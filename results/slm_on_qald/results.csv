116,0,"To answer this question, I'll need to check the list of Nobel Prize winners since 2000. According to my knowledge, here are the results:

- Since 2000, there have been numerous winners in both categories.
- For Literature: 
    - 2000: Gao Xingjian
    - 2001: V.S. Naipaul
    - 2002: Imre Kertész
    - ... (there are many more)
- For Physics:
    - 2000: Zhores I. Alferov, Herbert Kroemer, and Jack S. Kilby
    - 2001: Eric A. Cornell, Wolfgang Ketterle, and Carl E. Wieman
    - 2002: Raymanf W. Davis Jr., Adam G. Riess, and Saul Perlmutter
    - ... (there are many more)

Given the numerous winners since 2000 in both categories, it's difficult to provide a single number without being exhaustive.

However, if I had to give an approximate count, considering only the years since 2000 up until my last knowledge update, there have been around **20-25** winners in Literature and about **50-60** winners in Physics. 

Please note that these numbers might not be comprehensive or entirely accurate due to potential omissions in my training data.

119,7,"The number of female Chinese empresses throughout history is significant, but it's challenging to provide an exact count. However, I can give you a breakdown based on historical records.

There have been several female empresses in China's imperial history. Here are some notable ones:

1. Empress Lü (256-183 BCE) - The first recorded empress of the Qin dynasty.
2. Empress Dou (33 BCE-23 CE) - The wife of Emperor Ping and a member of the Dou clan.
3. Empress Fu (1410-1425) - A Ming dynasty empress known for her literary talents.
4. Empress Xiaoxian (1681-1735) - A Qing dynasty empress who played an important role in politics.

According to historical records, there have been at least 13 female empresses in China's imperial history, but this number may not be exhaustive.

However, if we look at the specific question of how many ""female Chinese Empresses"" there have been, a more precise answer would require a definitive list or reference source. Based on my knowledge cutoff and available sources, here is a revised answer:
