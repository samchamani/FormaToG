However, one famous poem titled 'The Owl and The Pussycat' (and associated with cats as well) was written by Edward Lear in 1871 and has no word Howl in it though. I found that the song 'The Howl' from Cats is actually not in many adaptations of the musical. However, I did find a poem called 'Owls are Wise', however another poem by T.S. Eliot was actually titled 'The Waste Land' published in 1922 and contains a reference to an owl. One Owl Poem was written in 1910 by T.S.
